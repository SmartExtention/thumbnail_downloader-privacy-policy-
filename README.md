# thumbnail_downloader-privacy-policy-

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how the YouTube Thumbnail Downloader Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information.

Information We Collect
This extension does not collect any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email, or address).

It does not collect health, financial, authentication, communication, location, web history, or user activity data.

The extension only accesses the active YouTube tab to retrieve the video URL needed to download the thumbnail. This access is limited to your current browser tab and is not stored or transmitted.

How We Use Information
The video URL is used solely to fetch and download the corresponding YouTube thumbnail.

No data is stored, shared, or sold.

Permissions
The extension requests permission to access YouTube pages (https://www.youtube.com/*) to function properly.

It uses the downloads API to save thumbnails directly to your device.

Data Security
We do not collect or store any user data, so there is no personal information to protect.

The extension operates entirely on your device.

Third-Party Services
This extension does not use or share data with any third-party services.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.
